We just experienced a tiny earthquake!

You can see it [on the Raspberry Shake network](https://stationview.raspberryshake.org/#/?lat=-26.92656&lon=153.21995&zoom=9.060&event=rs2025qarmsa),
which I recently read about in [Filtered for bottom-up global monitoring (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/08/01/filtered).
The Raspberry Shake network reports a magnitude 4.9 earthquake at 2025-08-15 23:49:24 UTC with an epicentre of 26.5° S 152.1° E,
roughly 100km west of the Sunshine Coast.

I'm in Brisbane, which is about 140km away from the epicentre.
The house shook a little bit as if a really strong wind was blowing, but there was no wind outside.
