I recently finished playing Bioshock. It only took two years.

## Outline

* Game development lineage
  * [Looking Glass Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looking_Glass_Studios) and [Irrational Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_Games)
    * Considered to have pioneered the ["Immersive sim"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim) genre
    * [System Shock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock) & [System Shock 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Shock_2)
    * [Thief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project) & [Thief 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II)
  * Irrational Games Australia [formed in ~2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20010203123200/http://irrationalgames.com/news_archived.cfm), renamed to [2K Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2K_Australia) after being acquired by a holding company.
    * Codeveloped Bioshock
* Game design
  * Relationship to the ["immersive sim"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersive_sim) genre
  * [Puzzles are problems with a single solution](https://www.raphkoster.com/2025/11/03/game-design-is-simple-actually/#:~:text=If%20a%20problem%20basically%20has%20one%20answer,%20we%20often%20call%20it%20a%20puzzle.)
    * We end up finding algorithms to solve the puzzle
    * Once you know the algorithm, executing it is straightforward
      * Lacks creativity
      * Boring, makes me feel like a machine
      * Frustrating if your mind doesn't work the same way as the creator's mind
      * Examples:
        * Arithmetic
        * Jigsaw puzzles
        * Sudoku
  * The "immersive sim" approach uses problems that don't have a single intended solution.
    * The game provides you highly general systems, and challenges you to acheive a particular outcome.
      You get to figure out how to use these systems to reach the goal.
    * More realistic, more relevant to the rest of life, which I find more fun
    * Encourages creativity
      * What are some plausible ways I could achieve that goal?
        Which of those are available to me given the rules of the game?
* It took me so long to finish because it was scary and stressful
  * The sound design had me on edge
  * Creepy enemies
  * I gave up on it for over a year, but wouldn't let myself play any other games until I finished this one
  * Recently I've been working on getting out of my comfort zone, so I decided that this was a good challenge for me.
    * This game is one of the safest ways to experience discomfort. A purely virtual experience in my home.
    * Noticing how avoiding uncomfortable states helps keep me in an unsatisfying place in life
      * I have a cognitive bias toward predicting negative and unpleasant outcomes
        * I also have the belief that it's important for me to avoid discomfort
        * Therefore I will avoid doing things that matter to me to minimise the risk of negative outcomes
          * But by avoiding the thing I necessarily also rule out the positive outcomes
      * Instead, practise acting in spite of the discomfort
        * Even though it feels like "too much", in each moment that you experience the discomfort *you are handling it*
        * "I am scared right now, but I don't *need* to be not-scared right now."
