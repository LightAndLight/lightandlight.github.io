[Vaibhav](https://vaibhavsagar.com/) offered [RocksDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocksDB) and [LMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database)
as candidates for "ZeroMQ for database storage".

Facebook has [a MySQL storage backend that uses RocksDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyRocks),
and LMDB has been used as a storage backend for [(a fork of) SQLite](https://github.com/LMDB/sqlightning).

I was surprised, because these databases describe themselves as key-value stores,
which doesn't seem like the right data structure for relational queries.
I had missed the fact that these are [*ordered* key-value stores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_key%E2%80%93value_store),
so they support range queries.
