In
[this
conversation](https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/304-why-i-left-twitter),
[Sam Harris](https://www.samharris.org) and [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com) talked about 
how we use the world wide web, how it has become extremely centralised around a few social media 
platforms, and the role of recommendation algorithms in this system. Parts of this conversation are
starting to influence the way I use the web.

Recommendation algorithms on social media don't optimise for general human flourishing.
They maximise metrics like engagement, views, clicks, or comments. To social media, all engagement is good,
regardless of its impact on your life.

Before centralised social media, we had a very organic recommendation system.
You read the blogs of people who you thought were interesting, and they linked 
to sites that they thought were interesting, and you would follow some of those links and find new 
content for yourself. In this organic system, *we* are the recommenders.
We can "optimise" our recommendations for things that are highly personal and very difficult to
measure, like curiosity, wonder, awe, learning, and insight.

I'd like to contribute to a more distributed, personalised, and organic world wide web, so I've
created a [resources page](/resources). I'll continue to add various web resources that I find
interesting, in the hope that others might use it to find something new.
