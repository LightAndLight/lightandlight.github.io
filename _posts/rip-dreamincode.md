[Dream.In.Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20220105235917/https://www.dreamincode.net/) was a
programming help forum that ran from 2001 to the beginning of 2022. It recently [shut
down](https://web.archive.org/web/20220116161045/https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/421898-dreamincode-shutting-down/)
due to hosting costs. My participation in Dream.In.Code, starting from 2009 and ending somewhere in
2013, represents the beginning of my life as a programmer. Programming is now a *huge* part of my life. I'd like to acknowledge the role this forum played in my development.

I learned to program by posting there. It was the only place I could 
get guidance about programming, because I knew no programmers in
real life.

web.archive.org showed that the form had been dilligently archived before
it went offline.

I scraped web.archive.org for my old posts and I found about 20.

I was surprised by how patient and kind everyone was.

I was ~13 years old when I started posting there.

Looking back at those initial posts: I didn't even
know how to ask the questions that I needed answered. The best I could
do was say, "my code is broken, please help".

But every single time there were people giving patient, constructive
responses.

Posters tolerated my cringy teen writing style style ("so umm... my code doesn't work. halp pls? thx
xD").

Where can people go for that kind of interaction? StackOverflow is 
definitely not the place.

It might be my nostalgia talking, but reddit doesn't seem like the
right sort of place either. It seems... colder.

How would my programming journey have looked if I hadn't found a place like 
dream.in.code?
