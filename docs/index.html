  <p>We just experienced a tiny earthquake!</p>
<p>You can see it <a href="https://stationview.raspberryshake.org/#/?lat=-26.92656&amp;lon=153.21995&amp;zoom=9.060&amp;event=rs2025qarmsa">on the Raspberry Shake network</a>,
which I recently read about in <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2025/08/01/filtered">Filtered for bottom-up global monitoring (Interconnected)</a>.
The Raspberry Shake network reports a magnitude 4.9 earthquake at 2025-08-15 23:49:24 UTC with an epicentre of 26.5° S 152.1° E,
roughly 100km west of the Sunshine Coast.</p>

The house shook a little bit as if a really strong wind was blowing, but there was no wind outside.</p>

    10 August, 2024
    
  </p>
  <p>A lot of Nix projects end up with their own binary cache (also known as a “substituter”).
Nix can be quite slow when it’s configured to use many project-specific substituters,
because it queries them all when checking if it needs to build a derivation. In a specific
project, most of the other substituters Nix knows about are irrelevant, and querying them
is wasted effort. My solution is to only enable <a href="https://cache.nixos.org" class="uri">https://cache.nixos.org</a> globally, and
to selectively enable other substituters while I’m working on a project that needs them.
Here’s how I do it.</p>

in a fresh journal, or twiddling with a synth I’ve just bought. The next day, though, the new tool
is a little less exciting, and so on, until it’s as normal as everything else.</p>

  Memory-sensitive languages like C++ and Rust use compile-time information to calculate
  sizes of datatypes. These sizes are used to inform alignment, allocation, and calling conventions in ways
  that improve runtime performance. Modern languages in this setting support generic types, but so far
  these languages only allow parameterisation over types, not type constructors. In this article I describe
  how to enable parameterisation over arbitrary type constructs, while still retaining compile-time calculation
  of datatype sizes.

  <p>I remember when I first learned about computer programming, around 2008 or 2009.
I wanted to make games, and asked a search engine. Apparently computer graphics
was way too hard, so I decided I wanted to create browser-based static HTML
games and text-based roguelikes. Having learned that PHP and MySQL exist, I sat
down and brainstormed a setting, classes and roles for characters, and all the
other things that come with fantasy RPGs.</p>

  <p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU">propositions as types
talk</a>, Philip Wadler contrasts
programming languages that have been ‘invented’ with those that have been
‘discovered’. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU&amp;t=28m12s">“And you can tell!” he exclaims, receiving giggles from the
audience</a>. Regardless of
how you feel about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics#Platonism">mathematical
platonism</a>,
I think Phil is pointing at a meaningful difference in the way certain ideas
arise.</p>

  <p>It’s difficult to learn functional programming without hearing about continuations. Often they’re mentioned while talking about boosting the performance of pure functional code, sometimes there’s talk of control flow, and occasionally with ‘time-travel’ thrown in there to make it all seem more obscure. It’s all true, but let’s start from the beginning.</p>

  <p><a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a> is a Linux distribution with declarative
configuration management. Your system configuration is specified in a
set of files, and can run a command to update your system to the current

  <p>LINQ is a system that provides a flexible query interface for .NET languages.
It allows a user to write queries over arbitrary data using an in-built
SQL-like syntax. This syntactic sugar is mapped to method calls at compile time,
so any data structure that implements the correct methods can be used with LINQ.</p>

  <p>Last semester I had to write a static website by hand with no templating
resulting in a lot of duplicated code across multiple pages. I had already
finished most of the project when I realised that the main page of the
project should be named <code>index.html</code> instead of <code>home.html</code>. I renamed the
file, but that left me with countless references to “home.html” that needed
to be changed, and I wanted to change them all at once. Enter <code>sed</code>.</p>

  <p>With so many programming languages and frameworks at our disposal, it is
too easy to believe that knowledge of many tools is the defining characteristic
of a good programmer. However, many experienced programmers will assert that
it isn’t the languages you know, but your ability to solve problems that
defines you as a programmer.</p>

  <p>Monad transformers combine the functionality of two monads into one. They are often used
as a way to “flatten” nested monads, but are also used to enable interactions between
monads that, when used seperately, would be incredibly difficult to implement.</p>
