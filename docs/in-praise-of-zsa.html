  <p><a href="https://www.zsa.io">ZSA</a> makes ergonomic keyboards.
I own two of their <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>s (one for work, one for home) which I use every day.
They also publish an <a href="https://www.zsa.io/the-ergo">email newsletter</a> that I subscribe to and happily read.
In the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/zsa/the-ergo-75">December 2024 issue</a>, they noted that ZSA doesn’t advertise (see <a href="https://www.zsa.io/trust">Why trust us | zsa.io</a>), and essentially rely on recommendations from customers.
I like ZSA and hope they continue to be successful, so this short article is my attempt to give something back to them without buying <em>another</em> keyboard.</p>
<p>My Ergodox EZs are great. I edit my configuration using
<a href="https://configure.zsa.io/">ZSA’s online configuration tool</a>
(here’s <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/60G6R/latest/0">my layout</a>)
and then flash a keyboard using <a href="https://github.com/zsa/wally">wally</a>.
The firmware has a lot of great features and has allowed me to turn my keyboard into a personalised programming tool.</p>

<p>I expect to use these keyboards for decades, and that’s something I can’t often say about products I own.
I think planned obsolescence is increasing because it can give businesses more consistent revenue over decades.
Why sell something for <code>$X</code> that will last 20 years, when you can sell one for <code>0.15 * $X</code> that lasts 2 years and have a customer purchase 10 (and throw out 9) over the same period?
Of course, the business metrics that improve as a result come at the expense of the customer and the world at large.</p>
<p>In contrast, ZSA really seems to be doing business right: existing to serve its customers, rather than existing to self-perpetuate.
My Ergodox EZ is <em>for me</em> in a way that many other technology products I use are not.
Every newsletter email I get from conveys sincerity and integrity that I find increasingly lacking in businesses, especially in the technology industry.
I wish them all the best.</p>
