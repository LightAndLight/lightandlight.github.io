  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220105235917/https://www.dreamincode.net/">Dream.In.Code</a> was a
programming help forum that ran from 2001 to the beginning of 2022. It was recently <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220116161045/https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/421898-dreamincode-shutting-down/">shut
down</a>
due to hosting costs. My participation in Dream.In.Code, starting from 2009 and ending somewhere in
2013, represents the beginning of my life as a programmer. Over the past 10 or so years, programming
has become a <em>huge</em> part of my life. I’d like to acknowledge the role this forum played in my development.</p>
<p>Dream.In.Code has been thoroughly archived on web.archive.org, so I scraped
the archives for my old posts. I was quite surprised by what I found.</p>
<p>I had forgotten how much of a beginner I was when I started posting there.
My initial posts
were variations of “I wrote this code and it doesn’t work and I don’t know why. Help?”
I could barely ask a coherent question.
Later, my questions became more targeted, like “How do I update all the items in an array?”
It was sobering to be reminded of a time when I didn’t know what a <code>for</code> loop was, and didn’t really
know how to figure it out for myself.</p>
<p>What left an even stronger impression was the quality of answers I recieved. Every question I asked
recieved patient, respectful responses. No one complained about my writing style (I was 13 at the time, and re-reading
these posts caused some eye-rolls). No one berated me when I left out helpful debugging information
like log files or compiler errors. No one made me feel bad for asking
questions. I think this was the best possible start I could have asked for. I’m not sure where
someone would go in 2022 for the same experience. Probably not Reddit or StackOverflow.</p>
<p>When I was learning to code, I had no one to turn to “in real life”. Posting a code snippet to a
forum and asking, “pls halp” was all I could do. The members of Dream.In.Code turned that into a
positive, constructive experience.</p>
<p>Thanks, Dream.In.Code</p>
