Hi! I'm Isaac.

Programming is one of my biggest passions, and I'm fortunate to be able to do
it for a living.
See my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/LightAndLight) for an overview of my interests and projects.
Music is another big passion of mine;
I played drums[^1] exclusively for ~13 years, and these days I enjoy [making music](https://soundcloud.com/LightAndLight).
Rock climbing is my favourite sport and I regularly go bouldering indoors.
I also have latent interests in visual art and writing, but I unfortunately my days only last 24 hours.

[^1]: Here are some covers I performed in 2017 while taking lessons with [Troy Wright](https://wrightdrums.com/): [Dystopia by TesseractT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9cGfX4w_Bc), [Para by Rendezvous Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSjIKimktBM)
