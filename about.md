<h1 class="centered">About Me</h1>

My name's Isaac. I used to work at [PaidRight](https://www.paidright.io/), where I helped design and implement systems that provide pay compliance insights to employers. Before that, I was part of the [QFPL team](https://qfpl.io/) at [CSIRO's Data61](https://data61.csiro.au/).

I'm particularly interested in programming language theory, functional programming, and formal verification.
