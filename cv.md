<h1>Curriculum Vitae</h1>

* Oct 2023 - present &mdash; Programmer at social discussion technology startup &mdash; Haskell

* Mar 2023 - Oct 2023 &mdash; Break

* Feb 2022 - Mar 2023 &mdash; CTO at [NineByte](https://ninebyte.com) &mdash; Haskell, AWS

  NineByte deals in digital education resources.
  Its specialties are: turning publishers' textbooks into online courses, hosting said online courses,
  and hosting [learning management systems (LMSs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system) for course delivery.
  I was responsible for setting a new technological direction,
  aiming to move the company from a B2B/consulting model to a software-as-a-service product.
  I created some foundational Haskell tooling for generating courses that can be imported into LMSs
  and for [LMS interoperability with external appplications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_Tools_Interoperability).
  I also set an example for day-to-day software development and operations:
  we moved from CodeCommit to GitLab,
  and started tracking work with issues and collaborating with merge requests.

* Jul 2020 - Feb 2022 &mdash; Software Engineer at [PaidRight](https://paidright.io) &mdash; Haskell, Elm, Nix, Google Cloud

  PaidRight calculates payroll compliance for Australian companies.
  I joined the team while it was incubating in CSIRO's Data61, and they rehired me after then spun out in 2020.
  While I was there the payroll models were written in a custom programming language and run via a web app.
  I contributed to the language runtime, the web-based structural code editor, and general web services.
  I also set up and was responsible for the CI system ([Nix / NixOS](https://nixos.org/) + [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/)).

* Feb 2020 - Jun 2020 &mdash; Bachelor of Computer Science (Programming Languages) student at University of Queensland &mdash; incomplete

  I completed one semester of part time study while working at CSIRO in order to make some progress toward getting a degree.
  I may have kept going, but then COVID happened.
  I switched to the newly-introduced Bachelor of Computer Science and transferred most of my BEng credits.
  Unfortunately I didn't learn very much;
  I completed some mandatory subjects that I was already an expert in because the university wouldn't give me credit.
  This included [Theory of Computing (COMP2048)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=COMP2048),
  for which I gave a guest lecture the year prior (and because of COVID they didn't record new material, so I was actually assigned my own lecture to study!).

* Jun 2017 - Jun 2020 &mdash; Functional Programming Engineer at [CSIRO's Data61](https://www.csiro.au/en/about/people/business-units/data61) &mdash; Haskell

  Data61 is a division of [CSIRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO).
  For 3 years I was a part of the [Queensland Functional Programming Lap (QFPL)](https://qfpl.io/),
  formed with the intention of improving functional programming adoption inside Data61 and in Australia at large.
  I wrote Haskell libraries (personally significant: [hpython](https://github.com/qfpl/hpython), [hedgehog-fn](https://github.com/qfpl/hedgehog-fn)),
  helped run in-person [introductory functional programming courses](https://github.com/system-f/fp-course),
  spoke at [YOW! Lambda Jam 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkTQASligqY),
  and gave a guest lecture at the University of Queensland for the subject
  [Theory of Computing (COMP2048)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=COMP2048).

* Jun 2016 - Feb 2017 &mdash; Software Developer at [iRecruit Australia](https://web.archive.org/web/20170204063104/https://irecruit.com.au/) &mdash; Python

  iRecruit was a startup working on a job matching platform.
  This was first programming job, and I worked part time while attending university.
  I worked on web services using Django.

* Feb 2014 - Jun 2017 &mdash; Bachelor of Engineering (Software Engineering) student at University of Queensland &mdash; incomplete

  After graduating high school I completed 2.5 years of a 4 year engineering degree.
  The most significant things I did during this time were:
  meeting a bunch of smart people who also loved programming,
  learning Haskell,
  and skipping classes to work on [my first serious compiler](https://github.com/LightAndLight/phil).
  
  I stopped going to university when I started working full-time at CSIRO's Data61.
