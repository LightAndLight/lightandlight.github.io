<h1 class="centered">Resources</h1>

On this page you'll find web resources that I enjoy. I hope you'll find something that interests
you. To start, [here](/web-resources-i-enjoy) is a short post about why I created this page.

## Computer Graphics

### Graphic Rants

<http://graphicrants.blogspot.com>

Brian Karis' (known for Epic Games' ["Nanite"](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine/) virtual geometry system) blog. A bunch of interesting
hardcore real-time graphics work from someone working at a triple-A studio. It's rarely updated
and most of the posts are from 5+ years ago.

### SIGGRAPH Advances in Real-Time Rendering

<http://advances.realtimerendering.com>

This [SIGGRAPH](https://www.siggraph.org/) track has *heaps* of information about state-of-the-art
graphics techniques, mostly used in games. There are lots of technical talks and slides.

## Philosophy

### Rationality from AI to Zombies

<https://www.readthesequences.com>

A compilation of blog posts about [rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationality). These
had a huge impact on me and my way of thinking during my early 20s, and I still re-read them now and
then. I don't know the right philosophy words to describe the genre.
[Materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism) is one that I do know.

I know some people who don't like this series because to them Yudkowsky comes across as arrogant; a sort
of "look at me I am very smart" vibe. I personally have never felt anything like that when reading
these posts.

## Programming

### Casey Muratori's blog

<https://caseymuratori.com>

Casey Muratori is a game developer. They've written a lot about API design, and
I still benefit from re-reading posts such as [Semantic Compression](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0015).
Their posts on software performance also stand out in my mind.

### Eric S. Raymond's technical essays

<http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/>

Eric S. Raymond (`esr`) is an old-school Unix hacker who's been publishing essays on the internet since the
90s. I find a lot of value in their analysis of Unix technical culture and design principles. My
favourite work is [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/), from which
I continue to gain insights on software design.

### matklad's blog

<https://matklad.github.io>

Alex Kladov's (known for [Rust Analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)) blog. They seem to
care about *good* software in ways that I relate to. Some values of "good": well-structured,
refactorable, understandable, efficient.

### nikic's blog
  
<https://www.npopov.com>

Nikita Popov's blog. They have worked on the
PHP VM and the LLVM compiler. I like it because they talk about fairly low-level programming
language performance (interpreters/VMs and compiler performance).

### Paul Graham's essays

<http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html>

[Paul Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(programmer))'s essays touch on topics like software
design, motivation, startup advice, and writing itself. Here are some that I enjoy:

* [Programming Bottom-Up](http://www.paulgraham.com/progbot.html)
* [Taste for Makers](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html)
* [How to Work Hard](http://www.paulgraham.com/hwh.html)

## Visual Art

### FZD School
  
<https://www.youtube.com/@FZDSCHOOL>

Feng Zhu is a concept artist who runs a [concept design school](https://fzdschool.com/) school out
of Singapore. On this channel he draws while talking. He often talks about drawing fundamentals,
advice for beginner/student artists, and his experience in art school and industry. There is a lot of
content and he rarely posts new videos.

### James Gurney

Blog: <http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com>

YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/@JamesGurney>

I learned about James Gurney because he wrote a highly recommended book, [Color and
Light](https://jamesgurney.com/products/color-and-light-a-guide-for-the-realist-painter-signed-by-james-gurney).
He is an *extremely good* artist. His blog is mostly about painting/visual art, and often includes art-related philosophy and neuroscience.
On his YouTube channel he posts wonderful narrated videos of [plein
air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_plein_air) painting.

## No category (read: weird, in a good way)

### Gwern Branwen

<https://www.gwern.net>

Gwern is a pseudonymous American writer and researcher. They write about a range of topics too
broad to list. To gesture somewhat in their direction, they are connected to the [[San Fransisco]
"bay area rationalist" community](https://www.bayrationality.com/), have a [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/gwern), use the [Haskell](https://haskell.org) programming language,
and [contribute to](https://www.gwern.net/Links#wikis) to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org).

### Scott Alexander

Original site: <https://slatestarcodex.com>

Substack: <https://astralcodexten.substack.com>

Bay-area rationalist psychiatrist who writes *a lot*. I simply find his opinions and cognitive
style *interesting*,
whether or not I agree. So
far, I prefer his old content (Slate Star Codex) to his new content (Astral Codex Ten).
